    "Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback, commonly known as **RLAIF**, is a specialized machine learning approach that amalgamates traditional reinforcement learning techniques and AI knowledge. This union offers a unique pathway to training artificial intelligence agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nature of RLAIF**: RLAIF can be understood as an iterative procedure. The system undergoes continuous improvement, adapting its learning function based on newly acquired AI feedback.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Safety and Trust**: Incorporating AI feedback ensures the system not only comprehends the tasks it should execute but also recognizes actions it should avoid. This dual capability fosters safer and more trustworthy systems.\n",
    "  \n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "RLAIF has proven instrumental in guiding language models, molding them to align better with intricate human values. As we venture into this notebook, we'll deep-dive into the methodologies and applications of RLAIF.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Models Utilized:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rewards Model**: \n",
    "   - A finely-tuned model designated for dispensing rewards based on the actions of the policy model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Base Model (Policy Model)**:\n",
    "   - The core model we aim to align using RLHF.\n",
    "   - During the RL process, this model becomes the \"policy model\", driving decisions and actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reference Model**:\n",
    "   - A frozen replica of the base model.\n",
    "   - Its primary role is to act as a benchmark, monitoring the evolution of the policy model throughout the RL process.\n",

    "\n",
    "We begin by initializing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) training class. The training process encompasses the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generation of Summaries**: \n",
    "  - Derived from the policy model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Reward Assignment**:\n",
    "  - The generated summaries are channeled through the rewards model.\n",
    "  - Based on these summaries, rewards are determined, reflecting the alignment of the policy model with human preferences.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Model Adjustment via PPO**:\n",
    "  - Utilizing the acquired rewards, PPO refines the weights of the policy model, nudging it closer to human preferences.\n",
    "  \n",
    "This iterative training loop continues for a predefined number of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-training, we evaluate the efficacy and alignment of the policy model post-RL to determine its proficiency in mirroring human preferences.\n",

    "\n",
    "In RL, a **reward model** is a mechanism providing feedback to the agent about its performance in its environment. Instead of predefined reward functions, reward models infer the reward signal from human feedback, especially useful in complex scenarios where crafting a reward function is challenging.\n",

It tokenizes the inputs, obtains the logits from a given model, computes the softmax probabilities, and finally extracts the scores (probabilities) and logits associated with each summary.\n",

    "### Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **model** (`torch.nn.Module`): \n",
    "    - The PyTorch model that produces logits given an input.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **tokenizer** (`transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer`): \n",
    "    - A tokenizer object used to tokenize input summaries.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **chosen_summary** (`str`): \n",
    "    - The chosen summary string that needs to be scored.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **rejected_summary** (`str`): \n",
    "    - The rejected summary string that needs to be scored.\n",

    "### Returns:\n",

    "- **chosen_score** (`float`): \n",
    "    - The probability score associated with the `chosen_summary` being positive or \"good\".\n",

    "- **chosen_logit** (`float`): \n",
    "    - The logit value associated with the `chosen_summary`.\n",

    "- **rejected_logit** (`float`): \n",
    "    - The logit value associated with the `rejected_summary`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tokenization**: \n",
    "    - The input summaries, `chosen_summary` and `rejected_summary`, are tokenized using the provided tokenizer. These tokenized inputs are padded or truncated to a maximum length of 512 tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Move to Device**: \n",
    "    - The tokenized tensors are transferred to the device (likely a GPU or CPU) where the model resides.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Obtain Logits**: \n",
    "    - The tokenized tensors are passed through the model to obtain logits. This is done in a no-gradient context to ensure computational efficiency and prevent any updates to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compute Probabilities**: \n",
    "    - The obtained logits are passed through a softmax function to get the associated probabilities. This helps in understanding how likely each summary is deemed \"good\" by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Extract Scores and Logits**: \n",
    "    - The function then extracts the probability and logit associated with the positive class (assumed to be the second class in the logits) for both summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "- The function assumes that the positive class (indicating the summary is \"good\") is the second class in the logits.\n",
    "- The softmax function ensures that the logits are converted into probabilities that sum up to 1.\n"

    "## Loading the T5 Model for RLHF Fine-Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "T5, short for \"Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer\", is a state-of-the-art model designed to handle various text-to-text tasks. In this section, we'll be loading a T5 model that is intended to be fine-tuned using the Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Selection**:\n",
    "    - We've selected the T5 model for our fine-tuning process. Specifically, we'll be working with the \"t5-base\" variant which offers a balance between computational efficiency and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loading Model and Tokenizer**:\n",
    "    - `policy_model_path`: Specifies the directory path where our pre-trained (or fine-tuned) T5 model is saved.\n",
    "    - `policy_model_name`: Indicates the model name, which in this case is \"t5-base\".\n",
    "    - Using the `T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained` method, we load the model weights from our specified path.\n",
    "    - Similarly, the corresponding tokenizer, which is essential for converting text into a format that the T5 model can understand, is loaded using the `T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Device Allocation**:\n",
    "    - The model is assigned to a computation device (either CPU or GPU) using the `.to(device)` method. This ensures efficient computation, especially when working with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test the Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "After loading, it's a good practice to perform some inference tests to ensure that the model is loaded correctly and is functioning as expected.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setting the Task Prefix**:\n",
    "    - We use the prefix \"summarize: \" to indicate to the T5 model the type of task we want it to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sample Text**:\n",
    "    - We have selected a post from the r/relationships subreddit to be summarized. This text provides context about a user's relationship concerns related to her bisexuality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generating the Summary**:\n",
    "    - We feed the concatenated task prefix and text into our T5 model.\n",
    "    - The model then processes this input and returns a concise summary. The `generate` function is used to obtain this output, and we've set a max length of 100 tokens for our summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Decoding the Summary**:\n",
    "    - The output from the T5 model is in the form of token IDs. Using the T5 tokenizer's `decode` method, we convert these tokens back into human-readable text.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Scoring the Summary using the Reward Model**:\n",
    "    - With the generated summary in hand, we then use our previously defined `score_summaries` function to evaluate the quality of the summary.\n",
    "    - This function returns a score and logit value for both the chosen summary and a rejected (blank) summary. Higher scores and logits suggest better alignment with what the reward model considers a good summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "By examining the printed scores and logits, we can gauge the perceived quality of the generated summary according to our reward model.\n"

    "\n",
    "### Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "Peft and LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) are techniques that enable efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained models by introducing low-rank structures into the models. Here, we'll configure the T5 model for this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setting up the LoRA Configuration**:\n",
    "    - `LoraConfig` provides the configuration settings for Low-Rank Adaptation.\n",
    "        - `r`: Rank of the low-rank structure. In this instance, it's set to 8.\n",
    "        - `lora_alpha`: Scaling factor for the newly introduced low-rank parameters.\n",
    "        - `target_modules`: Specifies which parts of the model to apply LoRA. Here, we're targeting the \"q\" (query) and \"v\" (value) modules.\n",
    "        - `lora_dropout`: Dropout rate for the low-rank parameters. Set to 0.10, or 10%.\n",
    "        - `bias`: Specifies the type of bias for the low-rank projection. We've chosen \"none\" in this case.\n",
    "        - `task_type`: Indicates the type of task. As we're using T5, the task type is set to `SEQ_2_SEQ_LM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Applying LoRA Configuration to T5**:\n",
    "    - Using the `get_peft_model` function, we apply the LoRA configuration to our pre-loaded T5 model.\n",
    "    - The returned model (`policy_peft_model`) is equipped with the Peft + LoRA modifications and is ready for fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our T5 model is now prepared with Peft + LoRA adjustments. This configuration optimizes the model for more efficient fine-tuning on specific tasks while leveraging the powerful pre-trained knowledge.\n"

    "After applying the Peft + LoRA configuration to our T5 model, it's essential to inspect the model's parameters to understand its structure better.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trainable Parameters**:\n",
    "    - This refers to the parameters that will be updated during the training process.\n",
    "    - In our configured model, there are **884,736** trainable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Total Parameters**:\n",
    "    - This indicates the complete count of parameters present in the model, including those that are non-trainable.\n",
    "    - The model consists of **223,788,288** total parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Percentage of Trainable Parameters**:\n",
    "    - It's useful to know the fraction of the model's parameters that are trainable, as this can influence training time and model flexibility.\n",
    "    - Only about **0.3953%** (or roughly 0.4%) of the entire model's parameters are trainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Peft + LoRA configuration results in a model where only a small fraction of parameters are trainable. This approach offers a balance, as it allows for specific fine-tuning while leveraging a vast pre-trained structure. The advantage is that it can lead to faster training times and might prevent overfitting, especially when training data is limited.\n"

    "### Defining the Reference Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In reinforcement learning, especially when fine-tuning models using methods like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), it's helpful to have a reference model. This model represents the initial state or behavior of the learner model (in this case, the Language Model) before any alignment or optimization. It aids in calculating the importance sampling ratio, a critical component for stable and effective updates in PPO.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **create_reference_model**:\n",
    "    - A function provided by Huggingface's TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning) library.\n",
    "    - Creates a duplicate of the passed model which acts as a reference during the RL fine-tuning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inputs**:\n",
    "    - The `policy_model` we previously defined serves as the input. This model acts as the basis for our reference model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Device Assignment**:\n",
    "    - Once instantiated, we move our reference model to the specified device (`device`) for computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "By defining a reference model, we set a stable baseline against which we can measure and guide the progress and changes of our main model during the reinforcement learning process.\n",

    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning (RL) requires a dataset to simulate experiences and provide feedback. In our RL setup for fine-tuning a language model, we utilize a comparison dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load Dataset**:\n",
    "    - Using Huggingface's `datasets` library, we fetch the 'CarperAI/openai_summarize_comparisons' dataset's test split.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Filtering**:\n",
    "    - We want to ensure the prompt lengths are manageable. \n",
    "    - Filtering by word count: We retain samples where the prompt has ≤ 450 words.\n",
    "    - (Alternative Filtering by character count is commented out for reference.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Shuffling and Sampling**:\n",
    "    - To ensure a diverse set of samples, we shuffle the dataset.\n",
    "    - We then select a subset (2,000 samples in this instance) for the RL process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feature Extraction**:\n",
    "    - From our shuffled dataset, we focus on the `prompt` and `chosen` fields. \n",
    "    - Rename the 'chosen' field to 'response' to align with the PPO library's requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Dataset Conversion**:\n",
    "    - Convert the dictionary containing our features into a Huggingface Dataset format.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Train-Eval Split**:\n",
    "    - Split the dataset into training and evaluation subsets. \n",
    "    - Here, 80% of samples are designated for training, and the remaining 20% are for evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcome:\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this process, we will have a training dataset and an evaluation dataset ready for the RL process. These datasets will be essential in guiding the model's fine-tuning and assessing its performance during the RL loop.\n"

    "For reinforcement learning, it is crucial that the data is in a format understood by the model. This requires tokenizing our textual data into numerical tokens. Here, we'll use the tokenizer associated with our model (T5 in this case) to process our datasets.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Tokenizer Initialization**:\n",

    "    - Define a function (`tokenize_function`) that:\n",
    "        - Processes the 'prompt' in each example of the dataset.\n",
    "        - Truncates or pads the tokenized prompt to a maximum length of 512 tokens.\n",
    "        - Returns the tokenized 'input_ids' for each 'prompt' and retains the associated 'response'.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Apply Tokenization**:\n",
    "    - Apply the `tokenize_function` to both the training and evaluation datasets using the `map` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcome:\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets (`train_dataset` and `eval_dataset`) are now tokenized and in a suitable format for model ingestion during the reinforcement learning loop.\n"

We recently had a breakup because I was distant and she thought I was cheating on her (which I wasn't). Before the breakup, she wanted to spend as much time with me as she could, but recently she has been very distant. We used to go to eachothers places overnight almost daily, but nowadays she does not want to come over to my place or want me to go over to hers (We both live on our own). She also used to talk to me all the time on facebook, but now she pretty much only replies to what I talk, and does not try to keep the conversation going. She has became pretty slow at replying, but when I'm with her, she replies instantly to her other friends who text her. \\n\\nI'm really lost at this situation, because I feel like she does not want to be with me anymore. I know that she's taking SSRI medications at the moment for anxiety. But she was taking them before we broke up for couple weeks. Her explanation for this situation is that she wants to spend some time alone, because she is working so much and never has time to be alone. This bothers me because she used to want to be with me all the time she could, and now she does not even try to schedule time for me.\", 'response': 'TL;DR:  gf has became very distant after we got back together, even though before we  broke up she was really into me.', 'input_ids': [3, 4138, 25582, 11253, 3177, 10, 3, 52, 87, 60, 6105, 2009, 834, 9, 26, 7287, 15, 332, 3177, 3765, 10, 784, 1755, 87, 51, 908, 499, 17442, 784, 1755, 87, 89, 908, 65, 582, 182, 10382, 11, 10088, 276, 14464, 10, 27, 43, 118, 16, 3, 9, 1675, 28, 82, 17442, 21, 3, 9, 385, 720, 147, 209, 215, 5, 101, 1310, 141, 3, 9, 1733, 413, 250, 27, 47, 10382, 11, 255, 816, 27, 47, 15009, 53, 30, 160, 41, 3339, 27, 2088, 31, 17, 137, 3103, 8, 1733, 413, 6, 255, 1114, 12, 1492, 38, 231, 97, 28, 140, 38, 255, 228, 6, 68, 1310, 255, 65, 118, 182, 10382, 5, 101, 261, 12, 281, 12, 284, 9269, 7, 1747, 8521, 966, 1444, 6, 68, 18811, 255, 405, 59, 241, 12, 369, 147, 12, 82, 286, 42, 241, 140, 12, 281, 147, 12, 160, 7, 41, 1326, 321, 619, 30, 69, 293, 137, 451, 92, 261, 12, 1350, 12, 140, 66, 8, 97, 30, 13301, 6, 68, 230, 255, 1134, 231, 163, 26719, 12, 125, 27, 1350, 6, 11, 405, 59, 653, 12, 453, 8, 3634, 352, 5, 451, 65, 1632, 1134, 2684, 44, 8776, 53, 6, 68, 116, 27, 31, 51, 28, 160, 6, 255, 26719, 8361, 12, 160, 119, 803, 113, 1499, 160, 5, 27, 31, 51, 310, 1513, 44, 48, 1419, 6, 250, 27, 473, 114, 255, 405, 59, 241, 12, 36, 28, 140, 7595, 5, 27, 214, 24, 255, 31, 7, 838, 3, 4256, 5593, 11208, 44, 8, 798, 21, 6261, 5, 299, 255, 47, 838, 135, 274, 62, 8238, 95, 21, 1158, 1274, 5, 1347, 7295, 21, 48, 1419, 19, 24, 255, 2746, 12, 1492, 128, 97, 2238, 6, 250, 255, 19, 464, 78, 231, 11, 470, 65, 97, 12, 36, 2238, 5, 100, 13965, 7, 140, 250, 255, 261, 12, 241, 12, 36, 28, 140, 66, 8, 97, 255, 228, 6, 11, 230, 255, 405, 59, 237, 653, 12, 2023, 97, 21, 140, 5, 1]}\n"

    "## Fine-Tuning with Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning offers a unique approach to fine-tuning models. The underlying principle is to allow the model to learn by receiving feedback (rewards) on its actions. In this context, an action would be generating a summary for a given text prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Loop Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The training loop we've crafted here follows this sequence of steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Prediction**: Using the policy language model (`ppo_trainer` in this case), we generate predicted summaries.\n",
    "2. **Score Generation**: We then pass these summaries to a reward model to assign a score (reward) based on the quality of the generated summary.\n",
    "3. **Model Update**: With the generated summaries and their respective scores, we use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to update our policy language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Model Prediction**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We iterate through our training data in batches (`prompt_tensors`).\n",
    "- For each prompt, we predict a summary (`summary_tensors`). This prediction is based on the generation hyperparameters we've specified (`generation_kwargs`), which guide the sampling strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Score Generation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each summary, we calculate a score by comparing it with a default rejected summary. \n",
    "- This step uses a separate reward model (`rm_model`), which assesses the quality of summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Model Update**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using PPO, we update our policy model based on:\n",
    "  - The initial input (`prompt_tensors`).\n",
    "  - The generated summary (`summary_tensors`).\n",
    "  - The assigned reward (`reward_tensors`).\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Key Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `objective/kl`: Measures how different the policy's action distribution after the update is from the action distribution before the update. PPO tries to make these changes very small to avoid drastic changes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `ppo/returns/mean`: This is the average return achieved by the agent. Higher is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ppo/policy/advantages_mean`: Measures how much better an action is than the average action at a given state. An advantage of zero means the action is just average, a positive advantage means it's better than average, and a negative one means it's worse than average.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HACK** Alert: The code contains certain hacks (like for handling variable sequence lengths) which were used to overcome specific issues during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reward Model**: The quality of the model training largely depends on the feedback it provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "### References:\n",
    "\n",

They had no problem with me being bisexual and it was something known before the relationship -- my first girlfriend was also bisexual. I am now in a relationship with a guy. We've been exclusive for about a month. Having never faced this issue, I come to you, Reddit. Is this something that he needs to know? Is it really relevant to a hetero relationship, regardless of if one of the participants in the relationship is bisexual? If you guys think it is necessary, when do you think is the right time? I think my biggest fear is losing him because of it. I know that I should be with someone who is fine with who I am, but I really like the guy and I'd hate for my sexual orientation to be the thing that kills this.\"\n",

It wasn't. It's now the next day. The lady in our assosciation keeps insisting that the water meter is in another condo.

This is our first place together here and we had to buy our own furniture. Needless to say we don't really have any money for trips. My friend is getting married in March in the USA and I feel really guilty out of obligation but I really don't want to go. I don't have the money for it and I don't want to leave here and miss my partner. Reasons for not wanting to go: 1. Money 2. Missing my partner. 3. Being incredibly bored once I'm there! I won't have a car or a way to get around, so I'll just be sitting in my parents house all day. I know it's bad that I don't want to go, but I am just really dreading it. Reddit, what do I do?\"\n",

Now, you see, my job is interesting and all, but it's an office job and I feel I'm not suited for this. I'm the adventures type, I want something happening around me and going to work from 9 to 6 is just killing me. The one thing that I thought of is a bike trip mostly in Europe, Asia and North Africa. The problem is that I'm from a country with an average salary around 350 euros or 450 USD. My salary is a bit higher - around 450 euros, but still not enough according to what I read is needed for such a trip, witch is about 30000 USD. My question is if somebody has done something like this without any money and if they have some tips for me. I'm thinking about sleeping outdoors or helping some locals for food and a place to crash. Is this something that could work out? I'm planning to go with my girlfriend and I think not too many people would take us in. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\"\n",

    "## Conclusion and Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we embarked on the ambitious journey of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with the aim to enhance text summarization. The major components of this approach are the policy model (in this case, a T5 model) and a reward model (based on BERT). Let's recap the steps we've taken and the knowledge we've gained:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading the Policy Model (T5)**:\n",
    "   - We began by initializing the T5 model which would act as our policy model for generating text summaries.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Loading the Reward Model (BERT)**:\n",
    "   - To evaluate the quality of the summaries generated by the T5 model and to give feedback, we employed a BERT-based model which was trained on a mixture of model-written summaries and human feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training Loop with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**:\n",
    "   - For the fine-tuning of our T5 policy model, we utilized the PPO algorithm, a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning method.\n",
    "   - We established a loop wherein the T5 model proposed text summaries which were then evaluated by the BERT-based reward model. Using these rewards, the T5 model was fine-tuned to better align with human preferences.\n",
    "   - Throughout this loop, we monitored various metrics such as the KL divergence, mean returns, and advantages to ensure that the training was progressing desirably.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Inference**:\n",
    "   - After the RLHF process, we put our enhanced T5 model to the test! By employing a dedicated function, we generated summaries for new input text, reaping the rewards of our fine-tuning efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging the strengths of both T5 and BERT, and by harnessing the power of reinforcement learning through PPO, we aimed to create a model that produces summaries of superior quality that are more in line with human preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future efforts can focus on refining the training process, experimenting with different RL algorithms, or scaling up the training data to further improve the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you for joining on this journey, and happy summarizing!\n"
